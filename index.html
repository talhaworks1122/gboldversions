        <h2>What is GB WhatsApp Old Version?</h2>
        <p>GB WhatsApp is a popular modified version of the official WhatsApp app, developed by third-party creators to offer enhanced features not available in the standard app. Old versions refer to earlier releases of GB WhatsApp Pro, such as v18.50 (June 2025), v18.45 (April 2025), and v18.40 (October 2024), which users seek for their stability, familiarity, and compatibility with older devices.</p>
        <p>These versions, like those from developers such as AlexMods, HeyMods, and Abu Saleh, provide customizations and privacy tools that appeal to users wanting more control over their messaging experience.
